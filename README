## About

The ubiquitous MPI environment in HPC cluster + Work Stealing Pattern +
Distributed Termination Detection = Efficient and Scalable Parallel Solution.

`pcircle` contains a suite of file system tools that we are developing at OLCF
to take advantage of highly scalable parallel file system such as Lustre and
GPFS. Early tests show very promising scaling properties. However, it is still
in active development, please use it at your own risk. For bug report and
feedbacks, please post it here at https://github.com/olcf/pcircle/issues. 


## Dependencies

`pcircle` is largely a Python implementation, but we don't rule out possible
and judicious integration of C/C++ code for performance gains. Currently, it
has the following dependencies:

- `Python 2.7.x` - it is not Python3 compatible, yet.
- `mpi4py` - wraps the MPI library 
- `xattr` - wraps the libattr library
- `cffi` - python interface to `libffi`
- `lru-dict` - wrap a small C-based LRU cache

## Installation

`xattr` dependency requires `cffi`, which depends on `libffi`, which is
notoriously difficult to install right.

- On Mac, you might have to manually do:

        brew install pkg-config libffi
        PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig pip install cffi

- On Redhat:

        sudo yum install openmpi-devel
        sudo yum install libffi-devel
      
- Then, the rest of setup is pretty much Python standard:

        python setup.py install


## virtualenv

If you have **setuptools** and **virtualenv** packages, then

        make deploy

It grab all dependencies and produce you a **container**, which isolate you from the default
installation:

        source ~/app-pcircle/bin/activate
        fcp -h

For this command to work, you do need a working `libffi` as well.
